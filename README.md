# Disable FastTravel if you're using this, otherwise they will fight over trying to set the speed.

This mod does not aim to introduce any changes to the game balance or mecahnics.

It is purely quality of life features.

The mod should aim to fit into the base game without looking like a mod.

**How to install**

1. Download and install [Unity Mod Manager](https://github.com/newman55/unity-mod-manager), make sure it is at least version 0.23.0
2. Run Unity Mod Manger and set it up to find Wrath of the Righteous
3. Download the Bubble Tweaks mod
4. Install the mod by dragging the zip file from step 5 into the Unity Mod Manager window under the Mods tab

**FEATURES:**

	Implementation of the wonderful FastTravel mod
		also adds support for a speed scale for tactical "homm-style" combat
		settings are adjusted using the native game settings window (ugly unity mod manager go away!)

	Army Disband button
		You can't disband armies that have generals
	
	Jump to Siege button
		Only jumps to the first village under siege, I will try to make it cycle through them

	GlobalMap Info Panel
		In GlobalMap mode, adds an expandable menu on the right hand side (under the mini-map), clicking on any entry pans the map to the location:
			Shows all your villages
			Shows all invading armies
			Shows all locations with quests

	Loot on the Local Map is coloured:
		Red - dropped by a dead unit
		Green - lootable object


	Cursor Enhancements
		Scalable cursor for combat/non-combat
		Full-attack text color can be semi-customised
